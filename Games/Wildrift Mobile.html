   <h1>LEAGUE OF LEGENDS WILDRIFT</h1>
   <div class="div1">
       
        <p>League of Legends: Wild Rift is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in the three-dimensional isometric perspective.[7] With a gameplay similar to the League of Legends PC version, the objective of the game is to take down the opposing team's base. To be compatible with mobile devices, Wild Rift received some adaptations, making the game faster compared to the PC version. Its map has been reduced in size, the respawn time is shorter, the gold gain is greatly accelerated and the regeneration time has been cut in half. Due to this, while on the PC version a match can last regularly 45 minutes, on the mobile version matches last approximately fifteen minutes. There are currently two different modes: Wild Rift (which covers PVP, ranked, and tournament draft) and ARAM. </p>
        <p>Each match is played by ten players who are distributed in two teams for a 5v5 confrontation. The players must each select a character, which are called champions by the game. To win the match, teams work together to destroy a structure called the Nexus in the enemy team's base, bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets. Unlike the PC version of League, inhibitors and Nexus turrets were removed, and the Nexus itself is able to attack target units. The mode has a ranked competitive ladder with a matchmaking system determining the player's skill level. There are currently 10 tiers; from least to most skilled, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Emerald, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger. </p>
