   <h1>POKEMON UNITE</h1>
   <div class="div1">
       
        <p>Pokémon Unite is a multiplayer online battle arena game, with standard matches consisting of two teams of five players. Each match is time-limited, and the team with the highest total score by the end of each match wins. There are limited time maps, and another gameode called quick battles, which is five minutes with 4 players on each team. A team can also win if the opposing team surrenders. Surrendering can only happen if the match reaches the halfway mark, and if a majority vote among the team members is reached. If there is a tie, the team that scored the tied score first wins.
            The game map, Aeos Island, is split into two halves, with multiple control points each. Players score points for their team by defeating non-player character "wild" Pokémon (referred to as catching in the game) and moving towards one of the control points.<br><br>However, if the players get hit by an attack while scoring, they will be interrupted, and must try again. Players can hold between 30 and 50 points depending on the stage of the game and their level. Each goal zone can hold a certain number of these points, and once the limit is reached, it will be destroyed. When players try to go on the opposing team's side of the map, when a goal zone is active, there is a zone called a "speed flux zone", which slows down the movement speed of enemy Pokémon entering it, but increases the movement speed of ally Pokémon. Destroying a goal removes a respective section of the "speed flux zone".
            At certain times in each match, stronger wild Pokémon will appear. Defeating one of these will provide the team which defeated it a unique effect based on which Pokémon was defeated. This includes Drednaw in the bottom lane, which gives the team which defeats it a shield and some experience points, as well as Zapdos in the jungle, which allows the team which defeats it to instantly score at the enemy goal zones. There is also Rotom, which appears in the top lane, and goes to the nearest goal and does 20 points, as well as making the team which defeats it instantly score in that zone.
