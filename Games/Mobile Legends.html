   <h1>MOBILE  LEGENDS</h1>
   <div class="div1">
       
        <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. The game is free-to-play and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins. Each player can control a selectable character, called “Hero”, with unique abilities and traits. There are 6 roles that define the main purpose of heroes: “Tank”, “Marksman”, “Assassin”, “Fighter”, “Mage”, and “Support”. These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Players can also set specific builds for heroes which include in-game items and emblems.</p>
        <p>Two teams of five players go against each other in real-time. Players will be matched in correspondence with their current ranking. There are seven ranks in the game with “Warrior” being the lowest followed by “Elite”, “Master”, “Grandmaster”, “Epic”, “Legend”, and the highest rank, “Mythic”. A player can only invite and form a team with other players of similar rank or players that are one rank higher or lower.
            Taking down the opposing base is the main goal to achieve victory. There are three lanes in the game: The gold lane (top), exp lane (bottom), and the mid lane. Depending on what side of the map (blue or red) a player starts on, the gold and exp lanes will be switching places. Between each lane is the jungle. The jungle can be divided into four parts: two between the enemy's lanes and two between a player's team lanes. The jungle has different creeps and monsters that offer buffs, experience, and gold.
            A player can't attack the enemy base directly without taking down opposing turrets in at least one lane first. Each lane has three turrets that shoot at heroes and deal a ton of damage. To attack them without taking damage, a player needs help from their team's “minions”. Minions constantly spawn at the teams’ bases and travel down along each lane. The team to successfully destroy all the turrets in one or all lanes will increase their chances of destroying the opposite team's base. 
            In classic mode, the gameplay is similar. However, winning or losing a match won't affect a player's ranking. Players can also form a whole team regardless of their rank differences and freely choose any heroes along with weekly free ones and any trial card they possess.
